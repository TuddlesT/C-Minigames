# C Minigames
Bundle of minigames that I programmed in C, mostly just to sharpen my C skills
## Mastermind
### Rules
A random 4-digit code is generated at the start of the game and you have 12 turns to correctly guess the code. If you get a correct digit in the correct place, you will be notified that there was an exact match. If you get a correct digit but in the wrong place, you will be notified that there was a partial match. Note that there are no repeats of numbers in the code
### To-Do List
* Make the random number generator more time-efficient
* Stop players from chosing multiple of the same number
